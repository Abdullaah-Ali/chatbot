Chatbot using Keras Functional API


This chatbot project aims to create an interactive conversational agent capable of responding to user queries based on the provided training data. The model is built using the Keras Functional API, a powerful and flexible way to create neural network architectures.

Features
Built using Keras Functional API
Trained on custom data
Utilizes TensorFlow for deep learning functionality
Incorporates scikit-learn for preprocessing and label encoding
Uses NumPy for numerical computations
Implements tokenization techniques for processing textual data
A simple structure of nueral network
integer encoding of the data
